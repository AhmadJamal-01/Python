<!-- What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents? -->

An AI Agent is a self-contained entity that perceives its environment, processes information, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents can be simple or complex, and they often operate autonomously or semi-autonomously. Common examples include chatbots, recommendation engines, and robotic systems. 

AI agents types

Reactive Agents: These respond to specific inputs without memory of past actions.
Proactive Agents: These can plan and make decisions based on goals and future states.
Learning Agents: These improve their performance over time based on feedback from the environment (e.g., reinforcement learning agents).



Compound AI Systems

A Compound AI System refers to a more complex architecture that integrates multiple AI agents or modules to achieve a broader or more sophisticated set of objectives. In these systems, several AI agents might work together, either collaboratively or hierarchically, to solve complex problems or perform tasks that a single agent could not handle alone.

Example

Distributed AI Systems: Multiple AI agents work in parallel to solve parts of a larger problem, such as in multi-agent systems where each agent may have specialized roles.
